# Casino-Game

In this game you are the floor manager of a slots casino. You can expand your fleet of slot machines, control the payout % and give out jackpots to attract more customers to your casino.

Don't get in too much debt though, your knee caps will likely be shattered if you get in too deep with the loan sharks.
